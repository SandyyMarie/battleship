Ongoing bugs we need to fix:

1. End game takes an extra turn to trigger end of game info/end of loop, 
need to have it execute either on same turn or before next turn
**fixed, needs code clean up with potential redundencies

2. When placing ships we need to have a verification for computer that it placed 2 ships
(in case it cancels due to overlap)***Stephen - soft fix


6. Need to add parameter so players/computer cant shoot the same shot twice *if cell fired upon?


#**** FIXed

TESTS TO ADD

1. Board.rb

2. Cell.rb

3. Computer.rb
    - starting_board
    - comp_place

4. Player.rb


5. Ship.rb
    - render x (removed render from ship, it's in cell)

6. Game_Manager.rb
    - welcome_message
    - end_game
    - turn

7. Turn.rb

    Refactor notes:

    In turn.rb we can remove the comp_board 
    and player_board variables alltogether by just calling computer.board and player.board
