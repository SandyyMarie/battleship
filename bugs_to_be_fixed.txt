Ongoing bugs we need to fix:

1. End game takes an extra turn to trigger end of game info/end of loop, 
need to have it execute either on same turn or before next turn
**fixed, needs code clean up with potential redundencies

2. When placing ships we need to have a verification for computer that it placed 2 ships
(in case it cancels due to overlap)

3. Need to fix endless loop when trying to make an incorrect/invalid shot 
(i.e- a22 sends into perma invalid coordinate loop)

5. Picking an invalid coordinate when placing player ships will break code all together,
need some type of parameters

6. Need to add parameter so players/computer cant shoot the same shot twice
