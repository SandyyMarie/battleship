Ongoing bugs we need to fix:

1. End game takes an extra turn to trigger end of game info/end of loop, 
need to have it execute either on same turn or before next turn
**fixed, needs code clean up with potential redundencies

2. When placing ships we need to have a verification for computer that it placed 2 ships
(in case it cancels due to overlap)***Stephen - soft fix


6. Need to add parameter so players/computer cant shoot the same shot twice *if cell fired upon?
